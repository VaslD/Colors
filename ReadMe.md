# Curated Color Palettes & Collections with Updater and Preview

## Usage

To obtain an updated copy of a color collection, `new` the corresponding color collection class and call `DownloadOnlinePalettes()`. Some class may take an optional `Langauge` enum that defines the localized name of colors and palettes.

The console sample also includes support for previewing color palettes in the Terminal, as long as the host executing the program supports ASCII color codes. Running the console sample will update and print out all collections included in this project.
